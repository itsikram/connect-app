# Video and Audio Calling Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Package Installation
- ✅ Installed `react-native-agora@3.7.1` (compatible with React Native 0.80)
- ✅ Installed `react-native-permissions` for camera/microphone permissions

### 2. Context and State Management
- ✅ Created `CallMinimizeContext.tsx` for managing minimized calls
- ✅ Updated `SocketContext.tsx` with video/audio call methods
- ✅ Updated `socketService.ts` with call-related socket events

### 3. UI Components
- ✅ Created `VideoCall.tsx` - Full-screen video calling interface
- ✅ Created `AudioCall.tsx` - Full-screen audio calling interface  
- ✅ Created `MinimizedCallBar.tsx` - Floating minimized call bar
- ✅ Updated `SingleMessage.tsx` with call buttons and handlers

### 4. Permissions Setup
- ✅ Added Android permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
  - Camera, microphone, audio settings, network access
- ✅ Added iOS permissions in `Info.plist`:
  - Camera and microphone usage descriptions

### 5. App Integration
- ✅ Added `CallMinimizeProvider` to `App.tsx`
- ✅ Added `MinimizedCallBar` component to main app
- ✅ Integrated VideoCall and AudioCall components in SingleMessage

## 🎯 Features Implemented

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Components Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── VideoCall.tsx          # Video calling UI
│   ├── AudioCall.tsx          # Audio calling UI
│   └── MinimizedCallBar.tsx   # Minimized call interface
├── contexts/
│   ├── CallMinimizeContext.tsx # Call minimization state
│   └── SocketContext.tsx       # Updated with call methods
└── services/
    └── socketService.ts        # Updated with call events
```

### Call Flow
1. User taps video/audio call button
2. Socket emits call initiation to server
3. Server forwards call to recipient
4. Recipient receives call notification
5. On acceptance, both users join Agora channel
6. Real-time audio/video communication begins
7. Call can be minimized/restored/ended

## 📱 User Experience

### Call Initiation
- Video call: Tap video camera icon in chat header
- Audio call: Tap phone icon in chat header
- Immediate local video preview for video calls

### During Call
- Full-screen interface with intuitive controls
- Real-time duration display
- Easy access to mute, camera, speaker controls
- Minimize button for multitasking

### Minimized State
- Floating bar at top of screen
- Shows caller info and duration
- Quick access to mute/camera controls
- Tap to restore full interface
- End call option

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Required for Testing
1. **iOS Setup**: Run `cd ios && pod install` (requires CocoaPods)
2. **Server Configuration**: Ensure Agora token endpoint is working
3. **Testing**: Test on physical devices (recommended for audio/video)

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Push Notifications**: Add support for missed call notifications
2. **Call History**: Track and display call history
3. **Group Calls**: Extend for multi-participant calls
4. **Screen Sharing**: Add screen sharing capability
5. **Call Recording**: Implement call recording features
